# Risk Panel Enhancements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the Risk panel with four key features as requested:
1. **Last-updated timestamp**
2. **Feature bars visualization**
3. **Diff reasons showing changes**
4. **Sparkline trend visualization**

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Changes

#### New Database Model (`apps/api/app/models.py`)
- Added `RiskSnapshot` model to store historical risk assessments
- Fields: `user_id`, `score`, `level`, `feature_scores`, `reasons`, `weights`, `thresholds`, `created_at`
- Uses JSON columns for complex data structures
- Automatically created via SQLAlchemy's `create_all()` method

#### Enhanced Risk Evaluator (`apps/api/app/routes/insights.py`)
- **Modified `evaluate_user_risk()`**: Now includes timestamp and optional snapshot saving
- **Added `_save_risk_snapshot()`**: Persists risk assessments to database
- **Added `get_risk_history()`**: Retrieves historical data for sparkline trends
- **Added `get_risk_changes()`**: Compares current vs previous assessment
- **Demo data support**: Provides sample data for all new features

#### New API Endpoints
- `GET /insights/risk/history?days=30` - Historical risk data for trends
- `GET /insights/risk/changes` - Risk changes since last assessment
- Enhanced existing `/insights/risk` endpoint with timestamp

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Updated API Client (`apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`)
- Added `getRiskHistory(days)` function
- Added `getRiskChanges()` function
- Updated return type documentation

#### Enhanced Risk Panel (`apps/web/src/components/InsightsPanel.tsx`)

##### New TypeScript Interfaces
- `RiskHistoryPoint` - For sparkline data points
- `RiskChanges` - For diff tracking data
- Updated `RiskData` interface with timestamp

##### New React Components

**SparklineChart Component**
- SVG-based mini chart showing 7-day risk trend
- Color-coded points by risk level
- Handles edge cases (insufficient data)
- Responsive scaling and smooth curves

**FeatureBar Component**
- Horizontal progress bars for each risk feature
- Shows score, weight, and calculated impact
- Color-coded by risk level (green/orange/red)
- Displays percentage contribution

**RiskChangesDisplay Component**
- Shows score changes with directional arrows
- Lists new vs resolved risk factors
- Highlights feature-level changes
- Timestamps for comparison context

##### Enhanced Main Panel
- **Header section**: Last-updated timestamp + sparkline
- **Changes section**: Dedicated diff display area
- **Feature analysis**: Replaced simple scores with interactive bars
- **Improved loading states**: Parallel data fetching

### 3. Key Features

#### Last-Updated Timestamp
- Shows when risk assessment was last calculated
- Formatted for local timezone
- Displayed prominently in panel header
- Stored with each risk snapshot

#### Feature Bars Visualization
- Visual progress bars for each risk feature
- Shows raw score, weight percentage, and weighted impact
- Color-coded based on risk thresholds
- Replaces simple numeric display

#### Diff Reasons (Change Tracking)
- Compares current vs previous assessment
- Shows score changes with directional indicators
- Lists newly identified vs resolved risk factors
- Feature-level change tracking
- Handles first-time assessments gracefully

#### Sparkline Trend Visualization
- Mini chart showing 7-day risk score history
- Each point color-coded by risk level
- Smooth polyline connecting data points
- Compact display with data point count
- Graceful handling of insufficient data

### 4. Demo Data Support
All new features include demo data for testing:
- 7-point historical trend with realistic score variations
- Sample risk changes with mock improvements
- Realistic feature score distributions
- Proper timestamp handling

### 5. Error Handling
- Database errors don't crash the application
- Missing data shows appropriate fallbacks
- Network errors display user-friendly messages
- Demo mode works independently of real data

### 6. Performance Considerations
- Parallel API calls for faster loading
- Efficient SQL queries with proper indexing
- Minimal DOM updates with React state management
- SVG-based charts for smooth rendering

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `apps/api/app/models.py` - Added RiskSnapshot model
- `apps/api/app/routes/insights.py` - Enhanced evaluator and new endpoints

### Frontend
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` - New API functions
- `apps/web/src/components/InsightsPanel.tsx` - Complete panel enhancement

## Usage

The enhanced risk panel now provides:
1. **Real-time updates** with clear timestamps
2. **Visual feature analysis** with interactive bars
3. **Change tracking** showing what improved/worsened
4. **Trend visualization** with mini sparkline charts
5. **Historical context** for better decision making

All features work in both demo mode and with real user data, providing a comprehensive risk assessment interface for the domestic violence support application.
